```sql
select title, rating from imdb
join earning on earning.movie_id = imdb.movie_id
where title like '%2012%'
and metacritic > 60
and earning.domestic > 100000000;
```

```sql
SELECT name 
FROM Salesperson
WHERE sales_id NOT IN (
    SELECT sales_id 
    FROM Orders 
    WHERE com_id IN (
        SELECT com_id 
        FROM Company 
        WHERE name = 'RED'
    )
);
```
### IMDb Max Weighted Rating

- [Question 4](./sql_solutions/beginner/question4.sql): Print the genre and the maximum weighted rating among all the movies of that genre released in 2014 per genre. (Download the dataset from console)

Note:
1. Do not print any row where either genre or the weighted rating is empty/null.
2.  weighted_rating = avgerge of (rating + metacritic/10.0)
3. Keep the name of the columns as 'genre' and 'weighted_rating'
4. The genres should be printed in alphabetical order.

```sql
SELECT 
    genre.genre, 
    MAX((imdb.rating + imdb.metacritic / 10.0)/2) AS weighted_rating
FROM 
    genre
JOIN 
    imdb ON imdb.movie_id = genre.movie_id
WHERE 
    imdb.title like '%2014%'
    AND genre.genre IS NOT NULL
    AND imdb.rating IS NOT NULL
    AND imdb.metacritic IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    genre.genre
ORDER BY 
    genre.genre ASC;
```

## Swap Salary

- [Question 5](./sql_solutions/beginner/question5.sql): Table: Salary


| Column Name | Type     |
|-------------|----------|
| id          | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| sex         | ENUM     |
| salary      | int      |

id is the primary key for this table.
The sex column is ENUM value of type ('m', 'f').
The table contains information about an employee.

```sql
update salary

 set sex=case 

 when sex='m' 

 then 'f'

  else 'm'

  end;
```

## Big Countries
- [Question 6](./sql_solutions/beginner/question6.sql): There is a table World


| name            | continent  | area       | population   | gdp         |
|-----------------|------------|------------|--------------|-------------|

| Afghanistan     | Asia       | 652230     | 25500100    |20343000  | 
| Albania         | Europe     | 28748      | 2831741     | 12960000  |
| Algeria         | Africa     | 2381741    | 37100000    | 188681000 |    
| Andorra         | Europe     | 468        | 78115       | 3712000   |
| Angola          | Africa     | 1246700    | 20609294    | 100990000 |    


A country is big if it has an area of bigger than 3 million square km or a population of more than 25 million.

Write a SQL solution to output big countries' name, population and area.

For example, according to the above table, we should output:


| name         | population  | area         |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Afghanistan  | 25500100    | 652230       |
| Algeria      | 37100000    | 2381741      |

```sql
select name, population, area from world
where area > 300000
and population > 25000000;
```

## Combine Two Tables

- [Question 7](./sql_solutions/beginner/question7.sql): Table: Person


| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |

PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
Table: Address

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |

AddressId is the primary key column for this table.


Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following 
information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

FirstName, LastName, City, State

```sql
SELECT 
    p.FirstName,
    p.LastName,
    a.city,
    a.state
FROM 
    Person p
left JOIN 
    Address a
ON 
    p.PersonId = a.PersonId;
```

## Director's Actor
- [Question 8](./sql_solutions/beginner/question8.sql): Table: ActorDirector



| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| actor_id    | int     |
| director_id | int     |
| timestamp   | int     |


Timestamp is the primary key column for this table.


Write a SQL query for a report that provides the pairs (actor_id, director_id) where the actor have co-worked with the director at least 3 times.

Example:

ActorDirector table:

| actor_id    | director_id | timestamp   |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | 1           | 0           |
| 1           | 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 2           | 3           |
| 1           | 2           | 4           |
| 2           | 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 1           | 6           |


Result table:

| actor_id    | director_id |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | 1           |


The only pair is (1, 1) where they co-worked exactly 3 times.

```sql
SELECT 
    actor_id, 
    director_id
FROM 
    ActorDirector
GROUP BY 
    actor_id, 
    director_id
    HAVING 
    COUNT(director_id) >= 3;
```

## Rank Scores
- [Question 9](./sql_solutions/beginner/question9.sql): Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.


| Id | Score |
|----|-------|
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |

For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):


| score | Rank    |
|-------|---------|
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 3.85  | 2       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.50  | 4       |

```sql
SELECT  
    Score, 
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Score DESC) AS "RANK"
FROM 
    Scores;
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Intermediate
Intermediate-level SQL questions including `JOINs`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and more complex aggregates.


### IMDB Rating
- [Question 1](./sql_solutions/intermediate/question1.sql): From the IMDb dataset, print the title and rating of those movies which have a genre starting from 'C' released in 2014 with a budget higher than 4 Crore.

```sql
SELECT imdb.title, imdb.rating
FROM imdb
JOIN genre ON imdb.movie_id = genre.movie_id
WHERE genre.genre LIKE 'C%'
  AND imdb.title LIKE '%2014%'
  AND imdb.budget > 40000000;
```
## Second Highest Salary
- [Question 2](./sql_solutions/intermediate/question2.sql):Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the 
Employee table.


| Id | Salary |
-----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.


| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| 200                 |

```sql
select salary from Employee
order by salary desc
offset 1
limit 1;
```
## Department Highest Salary

- [Question 3](./sql_solutions/intermediate/question3.sql): The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.


 | Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
 |----|-------|--------|--------------|
 | 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
 | 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
 | 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
 | 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
 | 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |

The Department table holds all departments of the company.


 | Id | Name     |
 +----+----------+
 | 1  | IT       |
 | 2  | Sales    |

  Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).


| Department | Employee | Salary |
|------------|----------|--------|
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |

Explanation:

Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.

```sql
select dept.name as "Department",emp.name as "Employee",salary as "salary" from Employee emp 
join department dept on emp.DepartmentId = dept.id

where salary in (select max(salary) from employee e group by DepartmentId)

order by salary desc,emp.name desc;
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Advanced
Advanced SQL questions covering `subqueries`, `window functions`, `CTEs`, and performance optimizations.

### IMDb Genre
- [Question 1](./sql_solutions/advanced/question1.sql):Print the genre and the maximum net profit among all the movies of that genre released in 2012 per genre.

Note:
1. Do not print any row where either genre or the net profit is empty/null.
2. net_profit = Domestic + Worldwide - Budget
3. Keep the name of the columns as 'genre' and 'net_profit'
4. The genres should be printed in alphabetical order.

```sql
select genre, max(earning.domestic + earning.worldwide - imdb.budget) as net_profit
from genre
join imdb on imdb.movie_id = genre.movie_id
join earning on earning.movie_id = genre.movie_id
where (earning.domestic + earning.worldwide - imdb.budget) is not null
and genre.genre is not null
and imdb.title like '%2012%'
group by genre.genre
order by genre.genre asc;
```
